# README #

This README documents the necessary steps to set up the running environment for scIMGCN.

### What is this repository for? ###

* scIMGCN is an interpretable, GCN-based cell-type annotation method for single-cell data, offering researchers a deep learning solution for single-cell annotation.
* Current version: 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setting up scIMGCN requires an environment with Python 3.8 or newer, along with PyTorch and other necessary machine learning libraries.
* Install all dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* scIMGCN does not require database configuration.
* Since scIMGCN is primarily used for research and development, it does not have a specific deployment guide. Please integrate it into your project or workflow as needed.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Please write appropriate tests for your contributions and ensure all tests pass.
* Submit pull requests for any changes. Project maintainers will review according to the project's coding standards.
